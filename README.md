# project-luna16-classification
Deep learning project for classifying lung nodules as benign or malignant using the LUNA16 dataset. Includes preprocessing, model training in PyTorch, and evaluation on 3D medical imaging data.


# Lung Nodule Classification: LUNA16 Dataset

This project implements a deep learning pipeline to classify lung nodules as benign or malignant using 3D CT scans from the [LUNA16 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanbyprinciple/luna-lung-cancer-dataset). It leverages PyTorch for model development and focuses on medical image analysis.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and annotation handling
- Model architecture design and implementation in PyTorch
- Training and evaluation on medical imaging data
- Hands-on experience with 3D data handling and image classification

## Dataset
The [LUNA16 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanbyprinciple/luna-lung-cancer-dataset) is used for this project. Download the dataset following the instructions in the notebook.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Conda (optional)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# OR
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate luna16-env
```

What I Learned: 
- How to handle 3D medical imaging data.
- Effective model design for medical datasets.
- Challenges and solutions for classifying lung nodules.
